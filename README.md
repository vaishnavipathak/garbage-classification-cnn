The Parameter Importance plot from the sweep revealed that the **learning rate was the most critical hyperparameter**. A lower learning rate (0.0001) was strongly correlated with higher accuracy.

Best Hyperparameters:
    Optimizer: Adam
    Learning Rate: 0.0001
    Dense Neurons: 512
    Dropout: 0.5
    Final Test Accuracy: 55.73%
